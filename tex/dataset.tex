Our primary dataset consists of numbers drawn in German lottery Lotto from 1955 onwards. We have focused on these dataset because of geographical locality
and historical depth of 70 years. Since its beginning, the rules have undergone slight changes, such as the introduction of "super numbers" in December
of 1991. Nonetheless, the core principle of the lottery, six numbers between 1 and 50 has not changed once in almost 70 years and thus provides a consistent
basis for our work.

\todo{Is there a dataset for a rigged lottery?}

However even 70 years of Lotto numbers is not sufficient to produce enough data for the diehard tests. These require 10 to 12 MB of random bits, which is
substantially more than 28.4 KB of Lotto numbers.

\todo{Merge datasets?}

The numbers are drawn individually, but their order within a single lottery draw does not matter - but maybe it does for some of our tests?
