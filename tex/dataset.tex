We began with the winning numbers of the German lottery Lotto, which are tracked at~\cite{lottoarchive} from 1955 onwards.
It became apparent early on, that much more data will be required, so we added numbers from other lotteries. Ultimately
we have collected 37 different lotteries, which in total provide almost 30 million numbers.

By volume, our data is dominated by the New York Quick Draw lottery, because it has been drawn every 4 minutes
for the last decade, adding up to to 25,663,100 numbers at our collection of the dataset.
Washington DC's Keno functions similarly, reaching 2,299,563 numbers over 3 years of existence. Our dataset is completed by
the "other" category, consisting of 1,917,890 winning numbers combined from lotteries drawn less often worldwide.

Our entire dataset originates from West-aligned countries. The reason is twofold - we have been looking
for them with English search queries and these nations are more likely to subscribe to ideas like open data and thus
offer such dataset as CSV files.
