\subsection{Hypothesis test results}

The $\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit test for the distribution of the German Lotto distribution 
of $d$ yielded a p-value of $0.4988592$. This is not significant at $\alpha = 0.05$ or 
any other common significance level.

This means that the German Lotto distribution of $d$ looks like a very typical
distribution for a fairly conducted lottery. We have no reason to suspect
human tampering from this result.
