In the first part we test whether the drawn numbers come from a uniform distribution $\mathcal{U}(1, 50)$. To investigate this,
we use Pearson's $\chi^2$ test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

For more information about the Diehard battery of tests we refer the reader to the original paper~\cite{currentRNG}.
