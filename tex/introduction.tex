Lottery/Hazard business is big many. Games such as lottery and dice are (probably?) one of the first application of randomness in human culture.
But for the same time organizers have cheated in lotteries, skewing the uniform distribution of drawn numbers expected by common sense for their
own monetary gain. We investigate the distribution of answers for the German Lotto lottery drawn from 1955 to the present day.

In the second part of this paper, we explore the "quality" of random numbers generated by lottery draws via the Diehard battery of tests~\cite{diehard}. These
tests were developed in the 1990's by George Marsaglia and are still in use today to test random number generators~\cite{modernRNG}.
