Lottery is one of the most obvious instances of randomness in everyday life. Many forms of lottery exist around the world,
though they are all based on the same fundamental idea: integers are being drawn from a certain interval without replacement,
with each integer being equally as likely as the others remaining. This project searches for evidence of this principle.

This report consists of four sections. Section \ref{sec:dataset} describes the data gathering process. In section \ref{sec:methods},
we apply a statistic test from~\cite{Drakakis} to several lotteries. Subsequently we explore the randomness of lottery through
the Diehard battery of tests in Section \ref{sec:diehard}. Finally we briefly discuss the limitations of our work in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
